# Customer_Churn_Analysis.

This project aims to analyze customer churn for a bank using real-world data. The goal is to understand the key reasons why customers are leaving the bank and to provide actionable insights to reduce churn. The analysis is performed using SQL for data exploration, Power BI for interactive dashboards, and a final presentation to summarize key findings and recommendations for stakeholders.
